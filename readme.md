This was a capstone project that had a delivery date of approximately 7 days to complete. The purpose was to create an eCommerce website showcasing something that I was interested in and wanted to sell to my class. I wanted to use my love for travel to aid others in travelling as well and create a simplistic design that's easy to follow.
